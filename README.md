> In my repositories you may find 2 colorala repositories. Don't be confused. The current repo for this project remains `/colorala.com`. I refactored the entire application code from scratch, taking inspiration from the <b>MVC architecture pattern</b>. The code in its current form is clean to me. The old source code is available in the repository `/colorala.com-old`.

# Available tools

- Color Palette Generator
- Hand picked Pre-made Color Palettes
